Unlike some other guitar libraries that rely on loops, String THeories â UNDEIGHT (KONTAKT) uses a combination of multi-samples and small repetition phrases that can be triggered by different velocities. This gives you more control and flexibility over the sound and performance of the guitar. You can play quarter notes, eighth notes, sixteenth notes, triplets, staccato notes, fade-outs, glides, harmonics, chuggs, and more with just one instrument.
 
The library also comes with pre-baked mean and nasty distortion that gives the guitar a powerful and aggressive tone. You can adjust the amount of distortion, reverb, delay, EQ, and filter to suit your taste and mix. The sound quality is excellent and the samples are well-recorded and edited.
