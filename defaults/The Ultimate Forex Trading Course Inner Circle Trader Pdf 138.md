Order blocks are zones of liquidity where institutional traders place their orders to enter or exit the market. They are often formed after a significant price movement or at key levels of support and resistance. Order blocks can act as reversal or continuation points, depending on the context and direction of the market. ICT explains how to use order blocks to anticipate market movements and trade with high accuracy and low risk.
 
Precision Trading Volume 1 is a 3-page PDF document that contains several charts and examples of order blocks in action. It also provides some tips and rules for trading order blocks, such as using multiple time frames, waiting for confirmation, and managing risk. The document is concise and easy to understand, but it assumes that the reader has some prior knowledge of ICT's trading concepts and terminology.
 
Inner Circle Trader Pdf 138 is a useful resource for traders who want to learn more about order blocks and how to apply them in their trading. However, it is not a comprehensive guide and it does not cover other aspects of ICT's trading system, such as market maker profiles, optimal trade entries, judas swings, and smart money concepts. Therefore, it is recommended that traders also study other ICT materials and practice on a demo account before trading with real money.

Another benefit of order blocks is that they provide clear entry and exit points for traders. ICT explains how to use order blocks to enter the market at optimal prices and exit at predetermined targets.

Order blocks are one of the core concepts of ICT's trading system and they can be applied to any market and time frame. However, order blocks are not a magic bullet and they require practice and discipline to master. ICT warns that traders should not rely on order blocks alone and they should also consider other factors such as market sentiment, news events, and technical indicators. He also advises that traders should test their strategies on a demo account before risking real money.
