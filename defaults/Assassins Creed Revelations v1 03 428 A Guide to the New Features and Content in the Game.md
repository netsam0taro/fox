Assassin's Creed Revelations is the fourth installment in the popular action-adventure series that follows the exploits of Ezio Auditore, a master assassin in the Renaissance era. The game was released in 2011 and received critical acclaim for its engaging story, immersive gameplay, and stunning graphics. However, like any other game, it also had some issues that needed to be fixed.
 
That's why Ubisoft released several patches for the game, the latest being v1 03 428. This patch was released in June 2021 and addressed some of the bugs and glitches that players encountered in the game. Here are some of the main features of this patch:

- Unlock Penrose portal as soon as the Subject16 DLC is detected. The Subject16 DLC is an additional content that adds more puzzles and secrets to Desmond's journey, the modern-day protagonist of the series. The Penrose portal is a special device that allows Desmond to access these puzzles. Before the patch, players had to complete certain requirements to unlock the portal, which could be frustrating. Now, the portal is unlocked automatically as soon as the DLC is detected.
- Prevent Desmond's Journey AFS Message to be displayed when collecting fragment. Desmond's journey is a series of first-person platforming segments that reveal more about his past and his connection to the assassins. In these segments, players have to collect fragments of Desmond's memories to progress. However, sometimes a message would pop up saying "Animus Fragment Synced" (AFS), which could interrupt the flow of the game. The patch fixed this issue and made the message disappear.
- New laser type: Yellow lasers that you can block. Lasers are one of the obstacles that players have to avoid or overcome in Desmond's journey. They come in different colors and have different effects. For example, red lasers kill you instantly, blue lasers slow you down, and green lasers make you invisible. The patch added a new type of laser: yellow lasers that you can block with your animus shield. This adds more variety and challenge to the puzzles.

These are just some of the improvements that Assassin's Creed Revelations v1 03 428 brought to the game. The patch also fixed some minor bugs and glitches that affected the performance and stability of the game. If you are a fan of Assassin's Creed Revelations, you should definitely download this patch and enjoy the game even more.
  
Assassin's Creed Revelations v1 03 428 also improved the gameplay experience of the main campaign, which follows Ezio's journey to Constantinople, the heart of the Ottoman Empire. There, he encounters new allies and enemies, such as the Ottoman Assassins led by Yusuf Tazim, the Byzantine Templars led by Manuel Palaiologos, and the enigmatic Prince Suleiman. Ezio also discovers more secrets about his ancestor Altair, the legendary assassin who lived during the Crusades.
 
The game features a variety of gameplay mechanics that make it fun and challenging. For example, Ezio can use a hookblade to zip-line across the city, climb faster, and perform new combat moves. He can also craft different types of bombs using various ingredients and use them for stealth or combat. Moreover, he can recruit and train new assassins and send them on missions across Europe and Asia. He can also defend his assassin dens from Templar attacks using a tower defense mini-game.
 
Another feature of Assassin's Creed Revelations v1 03 428 is the refined and expanded online multiplayer mode, which allows players to test their assassin skills against others from around the world. The multiplayer mode offers more modes, maps, and characters than before, as well as a new story mode that reveals more about the Templars' plans. Players can customize their characters with different outfits, weapons, abilities, and perks. They can also join different factions and compete for rankings and rewards.
