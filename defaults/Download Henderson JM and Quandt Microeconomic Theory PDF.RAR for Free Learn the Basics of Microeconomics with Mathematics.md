Microeconomic theory is the study of how individuals and firms make decisions and interact in markets. It covers topics such as consumer behavior, demand and supply, production and costs, market structures, welfare economics, and more. Microeconomic theory can be applied to various fields of economics, such as labor, industrial organization, public finance, and international trade.

One of the classic textbooks on microeconomic theory is *Microeconomic Theory: A Mathematical Approach* by James M. Henderson and Richard E. Quandt. This book was first published in 1958 and has been revised several times since then. It uses mathematical methods to formulate and analyze microeconomic models, such as calculus, linear algebra, optimization, and difference equations. The book assumes that the reader has some background in mathematics and economics, but provides appendices with reviews of the necessary concepts.
 
The book consists of 14 chapters that cover the following topics:
 
- Theory of consumer behavior
- The maximization of utility
- Demand curves
- Theory of revealed preference
- Theory of the firm
- Optimizing behavior
- Homogeneous production functions
- Cost functions
- Linear programming
- Derivation of supply functions
- The equilibrium of a commodity market
- Market equilibrium stability of equilibrium
- Dynamic equilibrium with lagged adjustment
- Multimarket equilibrium
- The input-output system
- Monopolistic competition
- Monopoly
- Duopoly and oligopoly
- Monopsony
- Welfare economics

The book is suitable for advanced undergraduate or graduate students who want to learn microeconomic theory in a rigorous and comprehensive way. It is also a useful reference for researchers and practitioners who use microeconomic models in their work. The book provides many examples, exercises, and problems to help the reader understand and apply the theory.

Microeconomic theory is not only useful for understanding abstract concepts, but also for analyzing real-world problems and issues. There are many applications of microeconomic theory in various domains of economics and other disciplines, such as business, law, public policy, health, environment, and more. Some examples of microeconomic applications are:

- How do consumers decide what to buy online or offline? How do platforms like eBay and craigslist facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers? How do online reviews and ratings affect consumer choices? These questions can be answered using consumer theory, demand theory, and market equilibrium theory.
- How do firms decide how much to produce and what price to charge? How do different market structures, such as perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition, affect firm behavior and market outcomes? How do firms compete or cooperate with each other in strategic situations? These questions can be answered using production theory, cost theory, supply theory, and game theory.
- How do labor markets work? How do workers decide how much to work and what wage to accept? How do employers decide how many workers to hire and what wage to offer? How do minimum wages, unions, discrimination, immigration, and unemployment affect labor market outcomes? These questions can be answered using labor supply theory, labor demand theory, and labor market equilibrium theory.
- How do public policies affect economic efficiency and equity? How do taxes, subsidies, tariffs, quotas, price controls, public goods, externalities, and market failures affect consumer surplus, producer surplus, social welfare, and deadweight loss? How can public policies be designed to correct market failures and achieve social objectives? These questions can be answered using welfare economics, public goods theory, externality theory, and market failure theory.
