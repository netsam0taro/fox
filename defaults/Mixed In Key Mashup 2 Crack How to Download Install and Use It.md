In this article, we will show you how to use Mixed In Key Mashup 2 to create your own music in minutes. You will learn how to:

- Beatmatch and sync your tracks
- Edit and adjust your tracks
- Export and share your mashups

## Adding tracks to your project
 
To start a new project, open Mashup 2 and click on the "New" button. You will see an empty timeline where you can drag and drop your audio files. You can add MP3 or WAV files from your computer or iTunes library. You can also browse the Mixed In Key website for some free samples and acapellas to use in your mashups.
 
Once you add a track, Mashup 2 will analyze it and display its key, tempo, energy level, waveform and song structure. You can see these information on the top left corner of each track. You can also rename your tracks by double-clicking on their names.
 
## Finding tracks that sound good together
 
Mashups work when tracks are harmonically compatible. That means they have the same or compatible musical keys. If basslines, vocals, or melodies clash, your mashup will suffer. With Mashup 2, harmonic mixing happens instantly. The software analyzes your music and helps you discover tracks that are 100% compatible.
 
To find compatible tracks, you can use the "Harmonic Filter" on the bottom left corner of the screen. It shows you the Camelot Wheel, a system that simplifies harmonic mixing by assigning numbers and letters to musical keys. For example, 8A is A minor and 8B is C major. Tracks that are in the same number or adjacent numbers are harmonically compatible.
 
You can click on any number on the wheel to filter your tracks by key. For example, if you click on 8A, you will see only the tracks that are in A minor or compatible keys (7A, 9A or 8B). You can also use the "Energy Filter" to filter your tracks by energy level (from 1 to 10). This way, you can find tracks that match the mood and intensity of your mashup.
 
## Beatmatching and syncing your tracks
 
Synching tempos of two tracks played at different speeds is called beatmatching. When done properly, two songs sound like one. With Mashup 2, you beatmatch like a pro. Matchup 2 instantly detects the BPM of your first track, and adjusts the tempo of any additional tracks to match.
 
To beatmatch your tracks, you can use the "Sync" button on the top right corner of each track. It will align the beats of your tracks and make them play at the same speed. You can also use the "Nudge" buttons to fine-tune the alignment of your tracks manually.
