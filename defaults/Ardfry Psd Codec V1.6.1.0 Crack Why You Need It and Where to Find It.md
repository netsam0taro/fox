# How to View PSD Files without Photoshop using Ardfry PSD Codec
 
PSD files are Adobe Photoshop Document files that contain layers, masks, filters, and other editing information. They are widely used by graphic designers and photographers for creating and editing images. However, PSD files are not compatible with most image viewers and editors, so you need Photoshop or a similar program to open them.
 
But what if you don't have Photoshop or you just want to quickly view a PSD file without installing any software? In that case, you can use Ardfry PSD Codec, a codec that enables you to view PSD files using Windows Photo Viewer or any other application that supports Windows Imaging Component (WIC).
